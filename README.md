# CS573 Final Project Proposal Rough Draft

# Data
In this project, I would use "Crimes against to woman in India" dataset. https://gist.github.com/lzlazmSylas/6be318f1ef48498d10f831bbd78782f3
This date set contains the crime cases information in different districts in each state in Inda from 2001 to 2014. I will visualize this data set in my project.
